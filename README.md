My doctoral project: Investigation of the cross-feeding mechanism of sialic acids between Staphylococcus aureus and commensal bacteria in the context of atopic dermatitis.

FLASH tools: For calculating the parameters -m (minimum) and -M (maximum), use Overlap = (2xReads) - Fragment. To observe the parameters read, use the command "zcat" for example (zcat /home/marcos/PRJEB59406/fastq_files/ERR10856949_1.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | wc -c). For the fragment, use the archive HTML generated by fastp and access the insert size estimation in the graph Peak.
